# Numerical solver for the linear advection equation
A program that uses three different finite difference methods to solve the linear advection equation: 
* Forward in time backward in space (FTBS)
* Forward in time center in space (FTCS)
* Center in time center in space (CTCS). 
        
Created for the Mathematics for Future Climate CDT course Numerics.

* scipy (v1.11.4)

## How to use
1. Download both 'functions.py' and 'run_me.py'
2. Check dependencies are installed
3. Run 'run_me.py'

This will produce the results and plots discussed in the report "Numerically Solving the Linear Advection Equation" by Orla O'Neill.
