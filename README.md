# Numerical solver for the linear advection equation
A program that uses three different finite difference methods to solve the linear advection equation: 
* Forward in time backward in space (FTBS)
* Forward in time center in space (FTCS)
* Center in time center in space (CTCS). 
        
Created for the Mathematics for Future Climate CDT course Numerics.
